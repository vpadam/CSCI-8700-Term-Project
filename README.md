--------------------------Ideas--------------------------

1.Uber app for parking at UNO. People share that they are leaving and receive $0.50 if they exchange their parking spot with someone looking for one.
   
--------------------------Next Due Date: 9/24--------------------------

9/24: initial requirements specification document + screen mockups

Use https://themes.getbootstrap.com/products/dashboard for your css and what not for the screen mockups

--------------------------To-do list--------------------------

   1.Start creating screen mockups
   
   2.Create initial requirements specification document


--------------------------GUIDELINES FOR PART 1--------------------------

Write a project proposal - the project can be any software application which benefits society

Define the context of the problem.

Define the overall system goals and scenarios.

Divide up the project into user stories and create a high level architecture. For each user story: refine into functional, object and dynamic models.

These models form the main body of the specification. The complete specification will use this format.

Create the prototypes: for each user story, develop a set of screen mockups.

Create a quick-and-dirty implementation of a subset of the user stories (to be specified by instructor) to prove that it is realizable.

Develop a set of acceptance tests for determining if the implementation conforms with the specification
